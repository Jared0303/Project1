<p>The  <i>Eiffel Tower</i> was initially built to serve as the entrance gateway to the International Exposition of 1889 as well as a testament to French industrial ingenuity. It has since come to represent the distinct character of the city of Paris and certainly catches the attentions of many.</p>
