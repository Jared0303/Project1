<p>The  <i>Notre Dame Cathedral</i> is one of the most notable monuments in Paris (and in all of Europe for that matter). This Catholic treasure is over 800 years old. It is located on a small island called the Ile de la Cite in the middle of the River Seine. The building of the cathedral was completed over the course of 200 years; it was started in 1163 during the reign of King Louis VII and was completed in 1345.</p>
